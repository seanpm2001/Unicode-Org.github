# Contributing to this project

## Contributor License Agreement

In order to contribute to this project, the Unicode Consortium must have on file a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) covering your contributions, either an individual or a corporate CLA. Pull Requests will not be merged until the correct CLA is signed. Which version needs to be signed depends on who owns the contribution being made: you as the individual making the contribution or your employer. _It is your responsibility to determine whether your contribution is owned by your employer._ Please review [The Unicode Consortium Intellectual Property, Licensing, and Technical Contribution Policies][policies] for further guidance on which CLA to sign, as well as other information and guidelines regarding the Consortiumâ€™s licensing and technical contribution policies and procedures.

- **Individual CLA**: If you have determined that the Individual CLA is appropriate, then when you open your first Pull Request, an automated comment will appear that contains a link you can follow to accept the Individual CLA.

- **Corporate CLA**: If you have determined that a Corporate CLA is appropriate, please check the [public list of Corporate CLAs][unicode-corporate-clas] that the Consortium has on file. If your employer has already signed a CLA, then when you open your first Pull Request, an automated comment will appear that contains a link you can follow to declare your affiliation with this employer. If your employer has not already signed a CLA, you will need to arrange for your employer to sign the Corporate CLA, as described in [How to Sign a Unicode CLA][signing].

Unless otherwise noted in the LICENSE file, this project is released under the free and open-source [Unicode License][unicode-license], also known as Unicode, Inc. License Agreement - Data Files and Software.
